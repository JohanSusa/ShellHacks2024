Project Overview
This web app helps users overcome social anxiety by offering daily, scalable social challenges, which get progressively harder over time as users gain confidence. The challenges are designed as a form of exposure therapy, encouraging users to engage in real-life social interactions, track their progress, and receive feedback.

The app is built with Streamlit as the frontend framework, allowing for quick development and easy user interaction. Python powers the logic behind the challenge system, and custom CSS enhances the UI design for a smooth, user-friendly experience.

Features
Daily Social Challenges: Users receive a new social challenge each day, with difficulty scaling as they complete previous challenges.
Progress Tracking: Users can track their progress over time to see how theyâ€™ve improved.
Custom Feedback: After completing challenges, users can reflect on their experience and receive tailored tips.
Scalable Difficulty: Challenges become progressively more difficult as users become more comfortable in social settings.
User-Friendly Interface: Streamlit offers an interactive and easy-to-navigate web interface with a sleek design enhanced by CSS.
