# ShellHacks2024
At ShellHacks, you can build any project you want using any technology stack of your choice. All projects are automatically eligible for the **Best Overall Challenge** and our prize pool.
However, ShellHacks and our sponsors also offer challenges involving specific themes or technologies that you can go after. These also have their own prizes! 

You can sign up for **as many challenges as you like** (as long as your project fits their criteria). 
Just make sure to indicate which challenges you would like to be considered when you submit your project through **Devpost on Sunday, September 29th.**
